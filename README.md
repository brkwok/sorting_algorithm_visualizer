# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project was created with create-react-app to familiarize myself with various sorting algorithms, JavaScript, React.js, CSS and more.

## Algorithms Used
1.  **Bubble Sort** is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order. It is known as the simplest sorting algorithm and has the time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

2.  **Selection Sort** sorts an array by repeatedly looping through the array to find the minimum element and putting the minimum element in the beginning. Selection sort also has time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).

3.  **Merge Sort** is a Divide and Conquer algorithm, meaning that it divides the array into two halves recursively and then merges the two. It is highly efficient and produce stable sort. The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n).

4.  **Quick Sort** like Merge Sort, uses Divide and Conquer. It is also recursive. However, unlike merge sort where most of the work is done in the combining step, quick sort handles most of the sorting in the dividing step. The worst-case running time of the algorithm is O(n<sup>2</sup>), but the average-case running time is as good as the merge sort's (O(n log n)) and normally outperforms merge sort.

## Future Implementations
* Add other sorting algorithms 
  * Heapsort
  * Shellsort
  * Insertion sort
  * Etc.
* Refactor code
* Work on styling for better user experience
